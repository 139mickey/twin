These are the changes to Borland MFC4.2.  I do not know what are the
differences between the various MFC distributions, so the differences
must be extrapolated.

afx.h:

Change the macro TRACE to an empty macro, i.e.

#define TRACE

There are two places where TRACE is defined, one with _DEBUG defined,
and one with _DEBUG not defined.  Second, change the declaration for
the two functions below so that it does not use the wchar_t type.  You
can use WCHAR as the replacement or 'unsigned short'.

_wcstombsz
_mbstowcsz

filecore.cpp:

There's an '#endif' after the function definition AfxGetInProcServer.
Move this '#endif' after the function definiton AfxResolveShortcut.

filest.cpp:

The include of types.h and stat.h are using DOS style slashes, change
them to UNIX style slashes.

strcore.cpp:

Change the function definition of _wcstombsz and _mbstowcsz to match
the change that was made to afx.h above.

trckrect.cpp:

The static const declaration of 'trackerTerm' must be initialized
to zero.  I.e. 'static const variable_name = {0};'  The original
source does not assign to {0}, which is not correct for a const
object.

wingdix.cpp:

Same as trckrect.cpp, except the variable name is wingdixTerm.

winmini.cpp:

Same as trckrect.cpp, except the variable name is winminiTerm.

That is it.  This should allow the MFC sources to compile with
the TWIN environment.  Note, there will be lots of 'pragma' warnings
and other 'undeclared' warnings.  These can be ignored for now.

Any problems or comments, please send them to the TWIN mailing
lists.  The mailing lists can be found at the Willows web page:
