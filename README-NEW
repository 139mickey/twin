Make sure you have all the dependencies! You need a Linux system (I'm using 
Ubuntu), X development libraries, a modern version of GCC (haven't tried Clang
yet), Flex, Bison, and make. 

Grab a copy of the repository: 

 git clone https://github.com/nepx/twin

Autoconf has already been run for you, so simply run ./configure with 
interpreter support: 

 ./configure --enable-intp

Theoretically, disabling the interpreter and letting applications run natively
should work, but winver-win95 simply segfaults. 

Run "make depend world" without any additional flags. Don't try anything fancy.
The TWIN build system is not meant to be executed in parallel or with other 
options. Subsequent compiles can simply use "make," without the "depend world"
slowing you down. 

Then, when you're done, run the following: 

 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./windows/ ./windows/xwin32
 
This allows the dynamic linker to find all the libraries that TWIN needs. It's 
a clunky invocation, but it allows you to run xwin32 without having to mess 
around with the system PATH or running "sudo make install."
