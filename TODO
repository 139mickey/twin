This is a list of tasks for contributors and current developers.  The
list is separated into long term tasks and short term tasks.  Short
term tasks are important changes that should/must be made as soon as
possible.  Long term tasks are not as urgent, but are still important. 
Wishlist is what TWIN should try to attain.

Short term tasks

	graphics/GdiDC.c rev 1.6 introduced a problem with calc.exe.
	This might be a problem with either calc.exe or the binary
	support.  There's nothing wrong with the changes to GdiDC.c.

	Some of the sample applications are getting X errors.  If the
	main window is moved, and the About menu is selected, an X
	error (invalid handle) occurs.

	modinfo is not being freed when an application exits.  I.e.
	when WM_QUIT is returned, the message loop is gone, but modinfo
	is still allocated.  Is the task still around?  Or is it that
	when the program is WinExec'ed again, we should do more than
	just look-up the handle of the module?

Long term tasks

	Back port the thread support of Twine to use the existing Drv
	Hook architecture.  Twine got the great idea of removing the
	hook interface. The hook interface is better than the osdll
	interface.  Though moving the source to the osdll directory was
	a good idea.

	Clean up include directory such that it can be installed into
	the system include directory for application development.  The
	non-Windows header files should be moved to twin/windows.

	Build the TWIN software on untested platforms.  Try the various
	options to configure, i.e. bin16/bin32 support, interpreter,
	etc.  This doesn't take much effort, only lots of CPU cycles. 
	If errors arise, just send the output to the development
	mailing list.

	Build native applications using TWIN libraries.  Some Win32
	API's will need to be stubbed or implemented.  Here is a list
	of some source code.  I haven't checked these links in a while.

		V library
		wxWindows
		GNU Chess

		http://www.cyclic.com/ (wincvs)

	Implement more Win32 API.  They must be portable, thus copying
	WINE code may not be possible.  I don't know if Twine is
	considering the side effects, as they seem to be developing on
	GNU/Linux only.

	Write documentation on how to debug binary applications.

Wishlist

	Add new objects to the resource compiler.
