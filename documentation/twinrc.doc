In the [boot] section, the variables control, windows and openpath have
previously been defined and described.  These additional variables are
defined: 

display=<server name>
        implemented=yes
        default=:0.0, if DISPLAY not set

        Allows a X display server to be defined in lieu of using the
        environment variable DISPLAY.  Must have permission to connect
        to that display. 

fatal={0|1}
        implemented=yes
        default=0

        If set to non-zero, a message box will be displayed if/when the
        application calls the Window API, FatalAppExit(), otherwise the
        application will just terminate. 

temp=<directory>
        implemented=yes
        default=/tmp, if TMP is not set
        
        This allows an alternative directory to be used rather than the
        /tmp directory.  If the variable TMP is set, it will override
        this value. 

tasking={0|1}
        implemented=yes
        default=1

        If set to 0, the library will not allow more than 1 win16 binary
        application to execute.  By typing ALT-F10, depending on your
        window manager, a dialog box will be started allowing additional
        applications to be started, and scheduled round-robin. 

In the [windows] section of the .twinrc file, the following are defined: 

DoubleClickRate=<double click time in milliseconds>
        implemented=yes
        default=250
        
        This allows the double click time to be set.  This is specific to
        the twin libraries. 

FontFace=<facename>
        implemented=yes
        default=Helv

        This allows the font facename of the system font to be defined. 

FontSize=<font size>
        implemented=yes
        default=18

        This allows the font size of the system font to be defined. 

FontWeight=<font weight>
        implemented=yes
        default=700, for win16, 400 for win32

        This allows the weight of the system font to be defined. 

IconFontFace=<facename>
        implemented=yes
        default=Helv

        This allows the font facename for icons in MDI windows to be
        defined. 

IconFontSize=<font size>
        implemented=yes
        default=14

        This allows the font size of the text used for icons to be
        defined. 

In the [xdos] section, the following are defined:  mode=value
        implemented=no
        default=250

        This is what will be returned by the dos interrupt for Get
        Equipment Flag. 

memory=value
        implemented=no
        default=640

        This is what will be returned to describe the amount of
        conventional memory. 

extended=value
        implemented=no
        default=15k

        This is what will be returned to describe the amount of
        extended memory.
